# Ecommerce Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)

## Overview

This Ecommerce Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a scalable and microservices-based platform that enables businesses to build and customize their ecommerce stores. With a focus on scalability, modularity, and performance, the platform supports essential ecommerce functionalities, including product catalog management, shopping cart flows, payment processing, inventory tracking, and personalized recommendations.

---

## Features

### 1. **Product Catalog Management**

- Hierarchical categories with flexible tagging.
- Search and filtering capabilities (powered by Elasticsearch).
- API endpoints for CRUD operations on products.

### 2. **Shopping Cart and Checkout**

- Persistent, user-specific carts with session management.
- Streamlined checkout process.
- Real-time stock validation during checkout.

### 3. **Payment Processing**

- Secure integration with Stripe and PayPal.
- Webhook-based payment status updates.
- PCI-compliant tokenized payment handling.

### 4. **Inventory Tracking**

- Tracks stock levels across multiple warehouses.
- APIs for real-time stock validation and updates.
- Seamless integration with Order and Product Services.

### 5. **Recommendation Engine**

- Personalized product suggestions using machine learning.
- Event-driven data ingestion (Kafka).
- Batch processing for real-time and historical data.

---

## Architecture

### **Microservices Design**

Each feature is encapsulated as an independent, loosely coupled microservice. These services communicate through REST APIs or gRPC and use event-driven messaging (via Kafka) for asynchronous workflows.

### **Core Services**

- **Product Service**: Manages product information and search functionalities.
- **Cart Service**: Handles cart operations and session management.
- **Checkout Service**: Orchestrates payments and order creation.
- **Payment Service**: Integrates with payment gateways.
- **Inventory Service**: Tracks and updates stock levels.
- **Recommendation Service**: Generates personalized suggestions.

## Installation and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Kubernetes** installed.
- Access to external services (Stripe, PayPal, Elasticsearch).
- Environment variables configured for database, payment gateway, and messaging systems.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shironzi/Ecommerce_Backend-as-a-Service.git
   cd ecommerce-baas
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with:

   - Database connection details.
   - Payment gateway API keys.
   - Kafka broker URLs.

3. **Build and Deploy Services**

   - Build Docker images for each microservice:
     ```bash
     docker-compose build
     ```
   - Deploy to Kubernetes:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f k8s/
     ```

4. **Verify Services**
   - Check logs for service health:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs -l app=<service-name>
     ```
